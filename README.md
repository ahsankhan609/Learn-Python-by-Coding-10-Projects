### mypy - https://pypi.org/project/mypy/

Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check them. Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch many programming errors by analyzing your program, without actually having to run it. Mypy has a powerful type system with features such as type inference, gradual typing, generics and union types.
